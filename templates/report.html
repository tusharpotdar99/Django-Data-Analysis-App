        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Creator:</strong> Tushar Potdar</p>
        <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Data Analysis App</p>
        <p>This project is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of analyzing and visualizing data. Users can upload CSV files, perform various data analysis tasks, and generate insightful visualizations. The application is built using modern technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient data analysis experience.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework used to build the web application, providing a clean and efficient way to develop and maintain the app.</li>
            <li><strong>pandas:</strong> A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, allowing for easy handling of large datasets and complex operations.</li>
            <li><strong>numpy:</strong> A core library for scientific computing in Python, essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.</li>
            <li><strong>matplotlib:</strong> A comprehensive plotting library that helps in creating various types of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.</li>
            <li><strong>seaborn:</strong> An extension of matplotlib, used for statistical data visualization, providing high-level functions for generating attractive and informative graphics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSV File Upload:</strong> Users can upload CSV files directly from their local system. The application supports various file formats and ensures proper validation of file types.</li>
